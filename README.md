# Swing Calculator

A very simple calculator written in Java, similar to the basic one that comes with the Mac.

After more than 10 years of Java development experience, I realized that I had never written a Java Swing application. So, I decided to build a simple calculator to learn how to use Swing, even though there is no practical reason to use this technology nowadays.
